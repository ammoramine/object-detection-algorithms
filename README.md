# object-detection-algorithms
implementation of  algorithm of objects detection with pytorch.

training of RCNN and of YOLO, is implemented, training is performed only on the classes "Bus" and "Truck"
Remark: of course, one can use other frameworks, like detectron2,
but the aim of the repo, is to reimplement from scratch (using pytorch), various deep learning algorithms, for object detection.
